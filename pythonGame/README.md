### **Quick lingo.** 

You're a Hunter investigating strange phenomenon in the modern world. After you create your character, you'll embark on Mysteries. There's an optional investigational stage at the start of each Mystery. Then there's a big battle where you have to take down a monster -- or die trying. 

- Try not to take Harm. You start at 0 Harm. If you take 7, you die. 

### **Rolling.**

It's an RPG, so you'll have to do a lot of stuff. Every roll is 2d6 + a Rating of your Hunter. 7 or higher is usually a success; lower is a failure. 

Your Hunter has 5 Ratings: Charm, Cool, Sharp, Tough, and Weird. The higher rating, the better. At the end of each Mystery, you get to increase one Rating by one. 

- Charm and Sharp are used interchangably in the investigation stage. 
- Tough and Weird are used interchangably in the big battle. 
- Cool can be used to run away in the big battle. 

That's all you need to know to jump in. Good hunting.
